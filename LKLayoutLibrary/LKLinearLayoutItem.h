 * An relative size within a layout

 * Weight will be used by layouts to determinate the overall weight.
 * The overall weight represents the whole available space in points minus all absolute sizes.
 *
 * The percentage of this item weight in relation to the overall weight is used to calculate
 * the items size within a layout.
 *
 * This prevents items to expand over the available layouts space and allows specifing sizes in relations such as having an item as twice as big as another one.
